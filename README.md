# Q-Simulator:PROJ-00131

Quantum simulators play a pivotal role in exploring quantum systems under controlled environments and refining quantum algorithms for practical applications. These tools provide valuable insights into the core principles of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and superposition. However, our existing quantum simulator relies on a constant noise model to emulate real quantum backends, which falls short of accurately replicating the dynamic behavior of quantum computers. Our work aims to enhance the fidelity of these simulators, ensuring a more faithful representation of quantum computing systems and their intricate operations.
